3.1. RPA deﬁnitions
Only 24 of the 125 papers reviewed explicitly attempt to deﬁne
Robotic Process Automation, and 28 papers position RPA by com-
paring and characterising it with respect to related ﬁelds.
Key themes mentioned in the deﬁnitions are that the purpose
of RPA is to replace human tasks in business processes by software
('bots') and that this software interacts with front-end systems sim-
ilarly to human users. There were. primarily. two different views
of the nature of the software robots (or bots): in some deﬁni-
tions. the software is rule-based [2.9—13] and primarily performing
repetitive, high-volume. lengthy. mundane tasks [14]; in others the
software is trained with data. advanced. complex or ﬂexible and
adaptable to circumstances [15.9]. In both cases. the software is
used to deliver business processes. including IT services [9]. Only
three deﬁnitions [16.1.14] were not limited to the software used in
RPA. but also hint at steps towards performing RPA in the deﬁni-
tion. which seems to be suggested by the term “automation". which
intuitively indicates a process rather than an artefact.
A detailed analysis of the deﬁnitions using Wacker‘s rules [17]
is included in Appendix A.
In our review. we found that RPA is positioned within a ﬁeld of
other concepts. as shown in Fig. 2. RPA is typically considered to
be more rule-based and structured than artiﬁcial intelligence. cog-
nitive automation or expert systems [13.18-20.14]. but may also
incorporate these techniques as a part of RPA [21]. However. [14]
indicates that RPA could be more aware and adaptable to change.
Compared to non-robotic (standard) automation and business
process management. RPA is considered to be a more lightweight
solution [22.23], targeting the front—end user interface rather than
the back-end and data layers [2425]. Furthermore. compared to
business process management. RPAis considered a bottom-up inte-
grating approach rather than a top-down standardising approach.
and is easier to conﬁgure [19,20,26—28]. A detailed analysis of the
comparison of RPA to other concepts is shown in Appendix B.

-This folder includes:
>a Main.xaml ﬁle is automatically created, which should hold your'main
work‘flow” ,
>all other automation .xaml ﬁles included in the project. Please note that these
ﬁles have to be linked to the Main.xaml through the invoke Workﬁow File
activity, because only the Main.xaml ﬁle is executed when you run a job.
>a .screenshots folder, if you are dealing with UI automation.
>a projectjson ﬁle that contains information about yOur automation project.
